Write a program WindChill.java that takes two double commandline arguments t
# and v and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab.
# Given the temperature t (in Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour),
# the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) to
# be:
# Note : the formula is not valid if t is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger
# than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).

    v = float(input("Enter velocity between 3 and 120"))

    if t > 50 or v > 120 or v < 3:
